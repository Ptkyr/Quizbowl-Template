# Quizbowl-Template
This is a template for writing Quizbowl packets.

The main features are the `tossup` and `bonus` environments which automatically number themselves, and the various answerline commands. An example with [code](./example.tex) and the [pdf](./example.pdf) is provided.

Formatting based off of 2022 ACF Nationals, other than the header (which can easily be changed).
