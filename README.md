# Quizbowl-Template
This is a template for writing Quizbowl packets.

The main features are the `tossuplist` environment (self-explanatory) and the `tossup` command which has an optional category argument, and two mandatory arguments for a clue and answerline. An example with [code](./example.tex) and the [pdf](./example.pdf) is provided.

I based formatting off of ACF Nationals, other than the header (which can easily be changed).

Support for bonuses coming soon! Formatting will also be based off ACF Nationals.
