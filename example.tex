\section{TOSSUPS}

\begin{tossup}
Inscriptions of this deity’s name on a píthos \pguide{PITH-oss} at Kuntillet Ajrud \pguide{ah-j’ROOD} were cited by
Francesca Stavrakopoulou \pguide{STAV-rack-uh-POO-loo} in a book arguing that this deity was deliberately edited out
of many narratives. In his book on \quotes{folk religion,} William Dever \pguide{DEE-ver} argues for the persistence
of this deity’s cult based on widespread finds of “pillar-base figurines.” Somewhat confusingly, the name of this 
deity also denotes a type of worship-site which often consisted of a sacred grove or tree, but is usually rendered
in English translation as this deity’s namesake “pole.” In the Bible, four hundred prophets of this deity and four
hundred fifty priests of Ba’al \pguide{bah-ahl} are brought into Israel on the orders of Ahab’s wife Jezebel. Hosea
\pguide{hoh-ZAY-uh} proclaimed a theological “divorce” from this fertility goddess. For 10 points, name this goddess
whom some scholars think was Jehovah’s wife and is not to be confused with the similarly-named love goddess Astarte.
\answer{\need{Asherah}}
[\also{Ashirat, Athirat}; 
\accept{\need{Asherah} pole};
\prompt{God's wife, YHWH's wife, Jehovah's wife} before \quotes{Jehovah's wife};
\reject{Ishtar, Astarte}]

\begin{tossup}
A novel set in this country ends with the protagonist gazing up at the aquamarine, egg-shaped mobile that hangs
above his baby daughter’s empty bed. In that novel set in this country, a character tearfully runs off after listening
to a recording of a plane crash and gets gunned down in front of a pool hall. The murder of ex-pilot Ricardo
Laverde \pguide{lah-VER-day} becomes an obsession of law professor Antonio Yammara in that novel from this country,
The Sound of Things Falling by Juan Gabriel Vásquez. An author from this country created a man who cannot remain
a clerk at the River Company of the Caribbean because his letters are too poetic, and who hires Leona Cassiani after
mistaking her for a prostitute. In that novel from here, a fall from a ladder while trying to recover a parrot kills
Juvenal Urbino \pguide{oor-BEE-noh}. For 10 points, from what country is the author of Love in the Time of Cholera?
\answer{\need{Colombia}}
[or Republic of \need{Colombia}; or República de \need{Colombia}]
\cluenote{The second author is Gabriel García Márquez.}

\begin{tossup}
An unpopular governor of this colony was called “Big Belly” by indigenous peoples since he weighed over 400
pounds, and was recalled after he answered twenty-two settlers’ reform petition by having their leader shot. It is
generally thought that settlers of this colony were the first to build log cabins in the Americas, a practice they
brought from the region of Savonia. This colony, created on a tract of land from Sankikan Kill to Minquas Kill,
suffered from the unpopular rule of governor Johan Printz. Printz’s successor, Johan Rising \pguide{REE-sing}
surrendered to the expedition by Peter Stuyvesant \pguide{STY-vuh-sent} that conquered this colony, including the sites
of present-day New Castle and Wilmington. For 10 points, what short-lived colony along the southern Delaware
River named its capital Fort Christina after the queen of its home country?
\answer{\need{New Sweden}}
[or \need{Nya Sverige} \pguide{NEW-uh S’VAR-yeh};
\prompt{Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey} before \quotes{failed};
\reject{Sweden, Sverige}

\end{tossup}


\begin{tossup}
This architect placed a black pyramid over the entrance gate to an estate that also features another pyramid
designed by this architect’s assistant. Sibyls protect the entrances of a structure this architect designed for that
estate’s garden called the Temple of the Four Winds, which was based on Palladio’s Villa Rotonda. In an example
of his “castle air” style, this architect formed a three-sided rooftop arcade by grouping all the chimneys of Kings
Weston House at its center. Despite having no training, this Kit-Cat Club member designed Castle Howard. Like
Christopher Wren, this man worked with Nicholas Hawksmoor, who designed the Long Library of a building from
which this architect was banned due to his grandiose plans. That building by this architect honors the Duke of
Marlborough’s victory in the War of the Spanish Succession. For 10 points, name this English Baroque architect of
Blenheim Palace.

\begin{tossup}
An algorithm for this task that relies on both a triangle self-attention module and an invariant point attention
module outputs its result as an LDDT confidence score. Roland Dunbrack’s rotamer library is used to benchmark
algorithms at this task. Rather than the root-mean-square distance, algorithms for this task are scored in
competitions like CASP \pguide{casp} with a global distance test on each C-alpha. David Baker’s lab popularized the
Rosetta force field for this task, and manages a citizen science project for it. This task minimizes a funnel-shaped
energy function by varying two di-hedral angles per residue. A convolutional neural net that dwarfs other
algorithms at this task was released by Google’s DeepMind in 2021. For 10 points, name this computational task
that replaces experiments like crystallography to predict the natural configuration of a string of amino acids.
\answer{\textit{de novo} \need{protein structure} prediction}
[or computationally predicting how \need{protein}s \need{fold} from primary
sequence;
\accept{any logical equivalents that mention \need{protein}s or poly\need{peptide}s AND secondary, tertiary, or 
quaternary \need{structure} or \need{fold}ing};
\needmorethan \ul{protein}s or poly\ul{peptide}s;
\needmorethan \ul{structure} prediction or \ul{fold}ing prediction by asking “Of what molecules?”]

\section{BONUSES}


\begin{bonus}
\vague As souls reach this structure, each picks a “pattern of life” to be reborn into from those scattered on the
ground, with some picking tyrannous lives and others the lives of animals. For 10 points each:
\bonusclue[h]{Name this structure marked by a rainbow-like column of light, which turns on a goddess’s knees. The 
stars, the planets, and the sun and moon rotate on this structure’s eight rims, each of which bears a singing woman.}
\answer{\need{Spindle of Necessity}}
[\also{Spindle of Ananke;, Distaff of Necessity;, Distaff of Ananke};
accept, but DO NOT OTHERWISE REVEAL, answers indicating the \quotes{\need{spindle} from the myth of \need{Er}} or 
\quotes{\need{spindle} from \work{The \need{Republic}} by Plato};
\prompt{spindle}]
\bonusclue[m]{This man reaches the Spindle of Necessity after seeing souls enter chasms in the sky and earth. He is 
stopped from reincarnating and awakes on his funeral pyre 12 days after dying in battle.}
\answer{myth of \need{Er}}
\bonusclue[e]{Er’s story ends this work, in which an analogy describes chained prisoners who think the shadows they 
see on a wall are the whole world.}
\answer{Plato's \need{Republic}}
[or Plato's \emph{\need{Politeia}}]
